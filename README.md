Learn about repositories.


I am standardizing on a methodology for developing code on a desktop and then transferring the code to a target computer.  My intention is to do the work on the desktop - using git for version control - and then saving to a repository. Then when the code is ready for deployment, move to the target machine and download the code from the repository.

Try to modify this file with VS Code and see if the format is known.
