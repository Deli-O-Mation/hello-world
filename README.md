Learn about repositories.


I am standardizing on a methodology for developing code on a desktop and then transferring the code to a target computer.  My intention is to do the work on the desktop - using git for version control - and then saving to a repository. Then when the code is ready for deployment, move to the target machine and download the code from the repository.
